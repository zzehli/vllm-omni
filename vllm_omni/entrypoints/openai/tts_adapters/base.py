"""Base contract for per-model TTS serving adapters.

This package factors the per-model ``if self._tts_model_type == ...`` dispatch
in ``serving_speech.py`` into one adapter class per model. Each adapter owns its
model's request normalization, validation, prompt/param building, sampling
overrides, and output policy, so adding a model means writing one adapter file
instead of editing the shared serving module in ~10 scattered places.

See the RFC for the full design (issue #4327).
