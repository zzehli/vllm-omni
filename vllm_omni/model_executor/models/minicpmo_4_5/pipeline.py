"""MiniCPM-o 4.5 pipeline topology (frozen).

Stage 0: Thinker — multimodal understanding + text generation.
Stage 1: Talker  — MiniCPMTTS + Token2Wav, emits the final audio waveform.

The thinker -> talker bridge passes the hidden states + token ids extracted
from the thinker output through ``minicpmo_4_5_omni.llm2tts``; the talker
runs MiniCPMTTS and the on-device Token2wav vocoder in the same process and
returns the waveform directly as the pipeline's final audio output.
