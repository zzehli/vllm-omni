"""HSDP/FSDP2 compatibility for online FP8 quantization.

vllm's ``Fp8LinearMethod.process_weights_after_loading`` ends with
``layer.weight = qweight.t()`` so that the Cutlass FP8 GEMM kernel sees its
B operand as column-major ``[K, N]`` (the TN layout required by Hopper FP8
``wgmma`` instructions). The resulting tensor is a non-contiguous transpose
view of a ``(out_features, in_features)`` row-major storage.

FSDP2 ``fully_shard`` rejects non-contiguous parameters because dim-0 sharding
on a column-major view cannot be a contiguous memcpy. The two requirements are
fundamentally at odds with the same physical buffer.

This module reconciles them by separating the views: keep the parameter as
the underlying ``(out, in)`` row-major contiguous storage (FSDP-friendly),
and inject the equivalent ``.t()`` at the GEMM call site so the Cutlass
kernel still receives a column-major B (zero-copy stride flip).

The transpose is injected inside ``ScaledMMLinearKernel._get_layer_params``,
which is the single place where ``apply_weights`` reads the weight tensor.
The rest of ``apply_weights`` -- including its ``output_shape = w.shape[1]``
computation and the eventual ``apply_scaled_mm(B=w, ...)`` call -- then
operates on a tensor whose shape ``(K, N)`` and stride ``(1, K)`` match
what the upstream FP8 kernel expects. No other upstream code is overridden,
which keeps us robust against future changes inside ``apply_weights``.
