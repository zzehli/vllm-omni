description: Self-check your branch before creating a PR — catch dead code, prevent new model-specific Python examples, verify accuracy/perf claims, validate PR title format, and confirm merge readiness. Use when the user says "precheck", "self review", "pre-submit check", or "check my PR before I open it." Never posts to GitHub.

# PR Pre-Check

Self-review your branch before creating a PR against `vllm-project/vllm-omni`. Two modes: **quick** catches showstoppers, **full** does a thorough maintainer-grade review. Never posts to GitHub; the report is for the contributor's terminal only.

## Mode Selection

| Mode | When | Time |
|------|------|------|
| **Quick** | About to push, final sanity check | ~3 min |
| **Full** | Ready for review, want maintainer-level scan | ~10 min |

Default to quick if unsure. Run full before marking a PR "ready for review."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Base Branch

```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main 2>/dev/null \
         || git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null \
         || echo origin/main)
echo "diffing against ${BASE_SHA}"
git diff --name-only ${BASE_SHA}...HEAD
```

### Step 2: Validate PR Title

Check the most recent commit message (or branch name if no commit yet) against the project convention. Valid prefixes:

| Prefix | Applies to |
|--------|-----------|
| `[Bugfix]` | Bug fixes |
| `[CI/Build]` | Build or CI improvements |
| `[Doc]` | Documentation changes |
| `[Model]` | New/improved models (include model name) |
| `[Frontend]` | Frontend changes (API server, OmniLLM class, etc.) |
| `[Kernel]` | CUDA/kernel changes |
| `[Core]` | Core logic changes (OmniProcessor, OmniARScheduler, etc.) |
| `[Hardware][Vendor]` | Hardware-specific (e.g., `[Hardware][Ascend]`) |
| `[Misc]` | Other changes (use sparingly) |

✗ if: missing prefix, wrong case (`[bugfix]`), or WIP/Draft in title.
⚠ if: `[Model]` prefix without the model identifier (e.g., `[Model] Add new model` — should be `[Model] Add <ModelName> ...`).

### Step 3: Categorize the PR

| Diff contains | PR type |
|---------------|---------|
| New files under `vllm_omni/model_executor/models/<name>/` | **New Model** |
| Changes to `vllm_omni/diffusion/` | **Diffusion Model** |
| `[Bugfix]` prefix or single-file fix | **Bug Fix** |
| Perf/benchmark/throughput claims in commit msg or diff | **Performance** |
| Everything else | **General** |

If multiple rows apply (e.g., a diffusion model is also a new model), union the checklists.

### Step 4: Run Checklist

Ask: "Quick mode or full mode?" Then walk the checklist for the detected PR type from [references/checklists.md](references/checklists.md). Each item produces ✓, ✗, or ⚠.

**Also run the Code-Quality sweep on every PR**, regardless of type or mode: the five diff-scoped checks in [references/code-quality.md](references/code-quality.md) — kwargs fragility, broad-except swallow, `Any`/wrong type hints, hot-path `.clone()`/`deepcopy`, and event-loop blocking — plus the advisory conventions (log level, structured logging, synchronization, cleanup, dependencies, naming) in [checklists.md](references/checklists.md). These count only lines the PR *adds* — the pre-existing backlog across the repo is out of scope.

**Also run the Examples-Policy check on every PR** using [references/examples-policy.md](references/examples-policy.md). Inspect only Python paths introduced by the diff. Treat a new model-, checkpoint-, vendor-, or family-specific Python example as blocking; do not report pre-existing example debt.

**Also run the Simplification pass on every PR** using [find-simplifications](../find-simplifications/SKILL.md). Keep it diff-scoped: inspect added or modified public APIs, state, abstractions, fallback and compatibility paths, data movement, and only the adjacent ownership needed to prove a candidate. Do not expand the pass into a repository-wide audit. Zero candidates is a valid pass; report only evidence-backed opportunities. Mark a candidate as blocking only when it proves a correctness or merge-readiness problem, such as newly unreachable code. Otherwise report it as a warning.

**Also confirm local pre-commit gates** from [docs/contributing/README.md](../../../docs/contributing/README.md#linting). GitHub Actions `SKIP` does not prove they passed. Full new-hook list: Omni SPDX (`vLLM-Omni project`); forbidden imports (stdlib `re`/`base64`, pickle, Hugging Face Hub API, Triton/TileLang); no new `torch.cuda` call sites; shellcheck (macOS/Windows must install the binary); mypy-3.10; test files have CI level + hardware marks; TTS `_tts_model_type` branches in `serving_speech.py` must not increase; markdownlint on `docs/`; Buildkite YAML schema. ✗ for growing `allowed_files` / `ALLOWED_FILES` or raising `MAX_MODEL_TYPE_BRANCHES` without review.

### Step 5: Print Report

```
Pre-check report for <branch>

  Mode: quick | full
  Type: <new-model | diffusion-model | bug-fix | perf | general>

  Dimension          Result
  ─────────────────  ──────
  PR title format    ✓
  Code quality       ⚠ 1 broad except, 2 Any hints
  Examples policy    ✗ new model-specific Python example
  Simplification     ⚠ helper duplicates an existing owner
  PR desc integrity  ✓
  Registry/config    ✓
  Dead code          ⚠ 2 warnings
  Accuracy           ✓
  Benchmark          ✗ missing software versions

  Verdict: 1 blocking | 2 warnings | recommend fixing ✗ before PR
```

**Severity:**

| Mark | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✗ | Blocking — fix before opening PR |
| ⚠ | Warning — consider fixing |
| ✓ | Pass |
| — | Skipped (not applicable) |
